##### <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/">lc 1. Two Sum</a>    

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
```

##### <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/">lc 42. Trapping Rain Water</a> 

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after rainin

```
Example 1:
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
```

##### <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/">lc 15. 3Sum</a> 
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
```

##### <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/array-partition-i/">lc 561. Array Partition I</a> 
Given an integer array nums of 2n integers, group these integers into n pairs (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) such that the sum of min(ai, bi) for all i is maximized. Return the maximized sum.

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,4,3,2]
Output: 4
```

##### <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/">lc 238. Product of Array Except Self</a>
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

<br>

##### <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/">lc 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock</a>
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

```
Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
