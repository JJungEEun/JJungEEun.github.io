You are given an array of people, people, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each people[i] = [hi, ki] represents the ith person of height hi with exactly ki other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to hi.

Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array people. The returned queue should be formatted as an array queue, where queue[j] = [hj, kj] is the attributes of the jth person in the queue (queue[0] is the person at the front of the queue).

**여러 명의 사람들이 줄을 서 있다. 각각의 사람들은 (h,k)의 두 정수 쌍을 갖는데, h는 그 사람의 키, k는 앞에 줄 서 있는 사람들 중 자신의 키 이상인 사람들의 수를 뜻한다. 이 값이 올바르도록 줄을 재정렬하는 알고리즘을 작성해라**

##### Input & Output
``` 
Example 1:
Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
Explanation:
Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.
Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Hence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue.
```

``` 
Example 2:
Input: people = [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]
Output: [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]
```

##### Solution
**Code 01**
- 다중정렬 이용
    + lambda 함수를 사용해 정렬
    + 두 번째 값을 이용해 삽입 

**Code 02**
- 우선순위 큐 이용
    + 첫 번째 값: 큰 순서대로 추출하는 최대 힙
    + 두 번째 값: 삽입되는 인덱스로 활용

##### Code
**Code 01**
```python
def reconstructQueue(people):
    """
    :type people: List[List[int]]
    :rtype: List[List[int]]
    """

    people.sort(key = lambda x:(-x[0],x[1]))

    output = []
    for p in people:
        output.insert(p[1], p)
    return output
```
